# spec-import

Use this skill to import existing product specifications into the IDD structure.

The source material may come from another repository, another methodology, a
documentation folder, issue-derived product notes, architecture records, or any
other durable intent format. Its organization may be completely different from
IDD.

## Rules

- Preserve source meaning. Do not normalize conflicting sources into a fake
  consistent specification.
- If imported sources conflict, keep the conflict visible and ask for
  clarification.
- If resolving a conflict requires research, create a spike instead of
  guessing.
- If source status is unclear, do not promote it to current normative intent
  silently.
- Do not import backlog items, issue discussion, temporary progress, or
  implementation status as normative intent.
- If imported intent already belongs to an existing current specification,
  update that document instead of creating a duplicate.
- Create new numbered documents only for distinct durable intent.
- Add imported current documents to `INDEX.md`. Add archived documents only
  when they are useful historical context.
- When useful, keep a short source reference in the imported document.

## Workflow

1. Identify which source documents describe durable product intent.
2. Separate current intent, old intent, temporary status, task notes, and local
   process details.
3. Rewrite current durable intent into existing or new numbered IDD documents
   under `.specs/`.
4. Put obsolete but historically useful normative intent under `.specs/archive/`.
5. Convert architectural rationale into ADRs and uncertainty checks into spikes.
6. Remove task notes, temporary status, and source-specific wrapper text from
   imported specifications.
7. Update `INDEX.md` for added current documents and useful archived context.
8. Preserve meaning during import. Do not introduce new requirements silently.
