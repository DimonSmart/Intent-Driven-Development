This project uses Intent-Driven Development.

Current product intent lives in `.idd/intent/`.

Use IDD only when working with durable product intent.

Do not load the whole `.idd/intent/` directory by default. Read
`.idd/intent/README.md`, `.idd/intent/INDEX.md`, then only relevant numbered specs.

Do not put local tasks, temporary implementation notes, generated plans, or chat
history into `.idd/intent/`.

## Document Lifecycle

Git stores history.

`.idd/intent/` stores only current product intent, ADRs, and active spikes.

There is no `.idd/intent` archive lifecycle.

Do not move obsolete specs to an archive. Delete obsolete, duplicated,
task-like, process-only, or incorrect documents from the working tree.

When product intent evolves inside the same product area, update the existing
spec directly.

When a product area is replaced by a substantially different product area,
delete the old spec and create a new owning spec.

ADRs are decision records. Do not archive superseded ADRs. Mark them as
`Superseded` and create a new ADR for the replacing decision.

Resolved spikes should be deleted after their outcome is captured in a spec or
ADR, unless they remain useful as active research.
